#Developed a Flutter mobile application that integrates with a RESTful API ('<https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts>') using the Dart language and the http package.

#

Implemented asynchronous programming with async and await for non-blocking API calls.

#

Created a Post class to model the data structure retrieved from the API.
Used fetch function in JavaScript to make HTTP requests asynchronously, which returns Promises.
The 'await' keyword is used before calling the fetch function so that the program waits until the
Utilized Flutter's FutureBuilder for effective state management, handling loading, error, and data presentation states.

Designed a clean UI with a main Scaffold, AppBar, and a responsive body that displays a loading indicator, error message, or a ListView of post titles and bodies.

Shared the project on GitHub for further exploration, showcasing practical experience in Flutter app development and API integration.
